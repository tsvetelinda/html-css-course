# Final Exam

This folder contains the tasks completed during my final exam at SoftUni. The first two folders showcase projects developed from scratch to replicate the layout shown in the provided screenshot, while the third folder focuses on enhancing code created by SoftUni to ensure responsiveness.

## Each folder includes:

* HTML and CSS files containing my code solution.
* A screenshot of the expected result, to serve as a visual reference.
* An "image" folder with images used in the webpage recreation.

Feel free to explore the material for learning or practice purposes!
