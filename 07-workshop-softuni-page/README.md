# Workshop - Build a Static Website - SoftUni Creative

The exercise is part of a workshop aimed at strengthening HTML and CSS skills. The screenshot and image resources were provided by SoftUni. <br>
My task was to develop the HTML and CSS from scratch, using the screenshot as a visual guide to recreate the static page layout.

## The folder includes:

* HTML and CSS files containing my code solution.
* A screenshot of the expected result, to serve as a visual reference.
* An "images" folder with images used in the webpage recreation.

## Additional Notes
* The page layout has been adapted for mobile devices to ensure responsiveness (maximum width of 610px).
* This task is part of a SoftUni workshop on static webpage recreation, focusing on refining visual accuracy and responsive design skills.
