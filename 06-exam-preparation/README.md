# Exam Preparation

In this folder, you’ll find exam preparation exercises based on SoftUni materials. Each folder contains a screenshot of the expected result, serving as a visual reference. While the screenshot and design are the property of SoftUni, the code solution provided is my own—except for the folder starting with "02." In that folder, the initial code structure is SoftUni's, and my task was to add the responsive design, which is implemented in the 'responsive.css' file.

Each folder includes:

* HTML and CSS files with my solution to the exercises.
* A screenshot of the expected outcome.
* A .txt file containing the text used in the exercises, in case you'd like to try them out yourself.

Feel free to explore the material for learning or practicing purposes!
